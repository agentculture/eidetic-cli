"""Markdown catalog for ``eidetic-cli explain <path>``.

Each entry is verbatim markdown. Keys are command-path tuples. The empty tuple
and ``("eidetic-cli",)`` both resolve to the root entry.

Keep bodies self-contained: an agent reading one entry should get enough
context without chaining reads.

_ROOT = """\
# eidetic-cli

A clonable template for AgentCulture mesh agents. It carries an agent-first CLI
(cited from the teken `python-cli` reference), a mesh identity (`culture.yaml` +
`CLAUDE.md`), the canonical guildmaster skill kit under `.claude/skills/`, and a
buildable/deployable package baseline. Clone it, rename the package, edit
`culture.yaml`, and you have a new agent.

## Verbs

- `eidetic-cli whoami` — identity probe from `culture.yaml`.
- `eidetic-cli learn` — structured self-teaching prompt.
- `eidetic-cli explain <path>` — markdown docs for any noun/verb.
- `eidetic-cli overview` — descriptive snapshot of the agent.
- `eidetic-cli doctor` — check the agent-identity invariants.
- `eidetic-cli cli overview` — describe the CLI surface.

## Exit-code policy

- `0` success
- `1` user-input error
- `2` environment / setup error
- `3+` reserved

- `eidetic-cli explain whoami`
- `eidetic-cli explain doctor`
"""

_WHOAMI = """\
# eidetic-cli whoami

Reports the agent's identity from `culture.yaml`: nick (`suffix`), backend,
served model, and the package version. Read-only.

## Usage

    eidetic-cli whoami
    eidetic-cli whoami --json
"""

_LEARN = """\
# eidetic-cli learn

Prints a structured self-teaching prompt covering purpose, command map,
exit-code policy, `--json` support, and the `explain` pointer.

## Usage

    eidetic-cli learn
    eidetic-cli learn --json
"""

_EXPLAIN = """\
# eidetic-cli explain <path>

Prints markdown documentation for any noun/verb path. Unlike `--help` (terse,
positional), `explain` is global and addressable by path.

## Usage

    eidetic-cli explain eidetic-cli
    eidetic-cli explain whoami
    eidetic-cli explain --json <path>
"""

_OVERVIEW = """\
# eidetic-cli overview

Read-only descriptive snapshot of the agent: identity (from `culture.yaml`), the
verb surface, and the sibling-pattern artifacts the template carries. Accepts an
ignored `target` so a stray path never hard-fails.

## Usage

    eidetic-cli overview
    eidetic-cli overview --json
"""

_DOCTOR = """\
# eidetic-cli doctor

Checks the agent-identity invariants `steward doctor` verifies:
prompt-file-present and backend-consistency (`claude` → `CLAUDE.md`), plus a
skills-present check. Exits 1 when unhealthy.

## Usage

    eidetic-cli doctor
    eidetic-cli doctor --json
"""

_CLI = """\
# eidetic-cli cli

Noun group for CLI-surface introspection. `cli overview` describes the CLI
itself (distinct from the global `overview`, which describes the agent).

## Usage

    eidetic-cli cli overview
    eidetic-cli cli overview --json
"""

_REMEMBER = """\
# eidetic-cli remember

Ingest one or more memory records. Accepts a single JSON object as a positional
argument, or NDJSON from stdin for bulk ingest. Each record is upserted
(idempotent by id) into the configured memory backend.

## Flags

- `--backend` — memory backend to use: `files`, `neo4j`, or `mongo` (default:
  `files`).
- `--scope` — scope name for the record(s) (default: `default`).
- `--visibility` — record visibility: `public` or `private` (default: `public`).
- `--json` — emit structured JSON output.

## Exit codes

- `0` success
- `1` user-input error (invalid JSON, missing required keys)

## Behavior

Each record must contain `id`, `text`, and `type` keys. When a positional JSON
argument is given, it is parsed as a single record. When omitted, stdin is read
as NDJSON (one JSON object per line). Upsert is idempotent: re-submitting a
record with the same `id` overwrites the previous value.
"""

_RECALL = """\
# eidetic-cli recall

Search the memory store and return matching records. Returns top-k hits, each
with text, full metadata, and a relevance score. Scope-aware: queries respect
the configured scope and visibility, with no private-to-public leak.

## Search modes (`--mode`, default `hybrid`)

- `exact` — case-insensitive verbatim substring match (`--case-sensitive`
  tightens it). Pure lexical; works with the embed server offline.
- `approximate` — vector cosine (semantic) similarity. Needs the embed server.
- `keyword` — BM25 lexical scoring; only records sharing a query term match.
  Works offline.
- `hybrid` — weighted alpha blend of min-max-normalised `approximate` +
  `keyword`: `score = alpha*approximate + (1-alpha)*keyword`. When the embed
  server is unreachable, `alpha` collapses to 0 (keyword-only) so hybrid never
  fuses meaningless offline-fallback cosine.

## Flags

- `--mode` — search mode: `exact`, `approximate`, `keyword`, `hybrid` (default:
  `hybrid`).
- `--alpha` — hybrid blend weight in `[0,1]` (default: `0.5`); only used by
  `--mode hybrid`.
- `--case-sensitive` — only used by `--mode exact`; require matching case.
- `--top-k` — maximum number of results to return (default: 5).
- `--filter KEY=VALUE` — metadata facet filter; repeatable.
- `--backend` — storage backend to query: `files`, `neo4j`, or `mongo` (default:
  `files`).
- `--scope` — query scope name (default: `default`).
- `--visibility` — query scope visibility: `public` or `private` (default:
  `public`).
- `--json` — emit results as a JSON list to stdout.

## Exit codes

- `0` success
- `1` user-input error (malformed filter, missing query, bad `--mode`/`--alpha`)

## Behavior

Returns up to `--top-k` hits sorted by relevance score. Each hit includes the
record text, all metadata fields, and a numeric score. Scope is enforced at
query time across every mode: a query with `--visibility public` never returns
records marked private, preventing accidental private-to-public leaks.
